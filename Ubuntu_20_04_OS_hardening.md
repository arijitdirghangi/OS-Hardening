### Preparation and Installation üõ°Ô∏è

#### Protecting a Newly Installed Machine from Network Threats ü™≤ <br/>
- When setting up a new system, it is vulnerable to network-based attacks until security configurations are in place. To mitigate this risk, the machine should be isolated from untrusted networks until it is fully installed and hardened.

- We can achive this using `router` or `host based firewall`. <br/>

<br/>

**So i have created vm (`Ubuntu 20.04`) on Hyper-V**
- We can create a separate switch, which isolates vm from our Host machine network.
- Another way, we can install an **Host Based firewall** (ex: UFW) and block all incomming connection, Only allow connection from specific host on spcific port.


**We‚Äôre Using Host Based firewall (`UFW`) to isolate our vm :**
- Installing UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
    - `apt install ufw -y`

- If we want the VM itself to block incoming/outgoing connections:
```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow from 192.168.0.118 to any port 22
sudo ufw enable

# 192.168.0.118 is my Host Machine-Ip

#To Check number of these rules are
sudo ufw status numbered
```

#### Set a BIOS/Firmware Password üîí <br/>
- The BIOS/Firmware is a critical component of a system's security. Without proper protection, an attacker with physical access can modify boot settings, reset passwords, or boot from unauthorized devices to compromise the system. Setting a strong BIOS password helps prevent unauthorized access and security bypasses.

**üí° Steps to Implement:**

1. Access the BIOS/UEFI Setup Menu
    - Each manufacturer uses different keys to enter BIOS. Try pressing one of the following keys during startup
2. Set a BIOS/UEFI Administrator Password
    - Navigate to the Security or Password section.
    - Look for options such as `Supervisor` Password, Setup Password, or `Admin` Password.
    - Set a strong password and confirm the changes.

  <br/>

3. After reboot, if we try to enter BIOS it will ask for password

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13c6c550-7f79-4155-8e2d-598993a2618f" alt="" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

<br/>

---- 

#### Configure The Device Boot Order To Prevent Unauthorized Booting From Alternate Media <br/>
- To prevent unauthorized access and security bypasses, configure the boot order to restrict booting from external media. This stops attackers from using **live USBs** or CDs to bypass OS security controls.


**üí° Steps to Implement:** <br/>
- Disable Boot from External Media <br/>
- In BIOS settings, go to the Boot or Advanced Boot Options menu. <br/>
- Disable booting from USB, CD/DVD, and PXE (`Network Boot`). <br/>
- Set the Primary Boot Device to the internal hard drive. <br/>
- If possible, enable Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized OS loading. <br/> 

**Note ‚ö† :**
- While virtual machines (`VMs`) don't have a traditional BIOS interface like physical machines, you can still set a BIOS password within the VM's firmware settings. This can be achieved by accessing the VM's BIOS or UEFI setup during boot and configuring a password there to prevent any unauthorized changes in boot order.

<br/>

---- 

#### Disable USB Usage
- Disabling USB prevents unauthorized devices from being connected, reducing the risk of malware infection and data theft. This can be done via BIOS/UEFI settings, endpoint security solutions, or manually by blocking USB kernel modules.

**üí° Steps to block USB:**
- Check BIOS/UEFI settings for USB disable options.
- If using endpoint security, we can block USB from AV Policy.

<br/>

---- 

#### Use the latest version  of Ubuntu  
- Using the latest version of Ubuntu ensures that your system benefits from the latest security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Older versions may lack important security updates and feature enhancements, making them more vulnerable to attacks. 

**üí° Steps to Implement:**

- Check Current Ubuntu Version:     
   - Run the following command to check your current Ubuntu version: `cat /etc/os-release`
- Update System to Latest Version:
   - Backup critical data before proceeding with the upgrade.
   - Run the following commands to update the system to the latest available version:
```
sudo apt update -y # Update all packages to the latest version
sudo apt upgrade -y # Upgrade system packages
```

<br/>

---- 

#### Lock Physical Console Access üîê
- Disabling Ctrl+Alt+Del prevents accidental or forced reboots from the physical console, reducing the risk of unauthorized or unintentional system restarts.


**üí° Steps for Implementation:**
```
systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target # Disable Ctrl+Alt+Del reboot
```

### Filesystem Configuration üìÅ

#### Create a separate partition with the `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` options set for `/tmp`  <br/>
- Creating a separate partition for `/tmp` with the `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` options ensures better security by restricting potentially dangerous operations in temporary directories. This can help mitigate the risks associated with untrusted files, as well as prevent certain types of attacks, like privilege escalation and executing malicious code from temporary files.

- `nodev`: Prevents device files from being created in the "/tmp" directory.
- `nosuid`: Prevents the execution of set-user-identifier (SUID) programs in "/tmp".
- `noexec`: Prevents the execution of any binaries from the "/tmp" directory.

**üí° Steps to Implement:**
- During OS installation i already separated the `/tmp` to another hard-disk, so now we just need to set `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` on `/tmp` folder.
- There is a entry for `/tmp` directory already exits in `/etc/fstab` file, we need to modify line
  
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304fbf92-48b2-49a1-84df-7a9ace7fb97c" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- Now open `/etc/fstab` file in editor : `nano /etc/fstab`
- Add `nodev,nosuid,noexec` in the following line. 

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11dbbca8-dc22-493e-8da3-ebce2d1ae065" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- After updating `/etc/fstab`, run: `sudo mount -o remount /tmp`
- Verify the mount : `df -h /tmp` && `mount | grep /tmp`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3685951f-fe0c-4cee-8c9b-14842f868422" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- To ensure the options are applied correctly, check if the partition prevents execution and device files creation:
- Try creating a device file in `/tmp`: `sudo -u <username> mknod /tmp/testdevice c 1 3`
  - It should fail because `nodev` is set

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f66453-273d-482b-89f3-2fbdcb10a26c" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - If anyone run this command as `root` user it will `bypass` the restriction, so it's always good practice to lock `root` user account.   

- Try running an executable from `/tmp`: `nano /tmp/check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo LOL

chmod +x /tmp/check.sh
/tmp/check.sh
```

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fd8e98b-28cb-43fb-b489-ea64c8f7a530" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- It should fail because `noexec` is set.
  - Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
    - The `noexec` mount option is applied to `/tmp`, preventing direct execution of files. However, this restriction can be bypassed by explicitly invoking an interpreter, such as: `bash /tmp/check.sh`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b410621-e583-4e8c-8bdd-7f203060006d" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>    
 - To fully mitigate this risk:
 - Use `AppArmor` or `SELinux` to enforce execution restrictions at the system level.

---

**`üí° 2ND Scenario`**
If you didn‚Äôt separate the `/tmp` partition during OS installation and wish to do so now, follow the steps below.

- List your all available disks using: `fdisk -l`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42180ee9-0b35-44ec-8541-723452999b28" alt="df command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>  

- Create a new partition for `/tmp` using fdisk: `sudo fdisk /dev/sda` `#Replace with your disk name`
  - Press `n` to create a new partition.
  - Choose a partition number (e.g., 2).
  - When asked for the start sector, press `Enter` to use the default (next available).
  - When asked for the end sector, specify how much space you want (e.g., +13G for a 13 GiB /tmp).
  - Press `w` to save and exit.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de0b0f79-b6a4-4774-a636-ff479299d655" alt="" width="650px"></a>

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85a35f3-5afa-4713-b924-e49ebe28a3cf" alt="" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- Format the New Partition:
  - Format the new partition with a file system (e.g., ext4): `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdaX` `(Replace X with your partition)`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb4977b-5e7e-4935-923e-342c4985c182" alt="" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- Mount the New Partition with Security
  - Ensure `/tmp` is empty before mounting
    - It‚Äôs best to clear `/tmp` on `reboot` (this is common practice).
  - Backup current /tmp (just in case):
    - `sudo cp -a /tmp /tmp_backup`

  - Create a mount point and mount the partition: `sudo mount /dev/sdaX /tmp` `(Replace X with your partition)`
  - Add the following entry to `/etc/fstab` to ensure the partition is mounted on reboot:
    - `/dev/sda2    /tmp    ext4    nodev,nosuid,noexec    0    2` `(Replace /dev/sda2 with your partition)`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/387f5b83-b101-4b7e-b965-2d82c7c02de3" alt="" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- After updating `/etc/fstab`, run: `mount -a` & `sudo mount -o remount /tmp`
- Verify the mount : `df -h /tmp` && `mount | grep /tmp`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d0fc9f8-20b1-46e7-ada0-21880a35026c" alt="" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- Testing the security settings is same, as i mention above.üòä


<br/>

---- 

#### Create separate partitions for `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home` <br/>
- Creating separate partitions for `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home` provides better isolation, security, and management of system resources. These partitions allow for independent management, such as setting appropriate mount options and file system types, which can help protect sensitive data, ensure log retention, and optimize performance. It also prevents one partition from filling up and impacting others.


**üí° Steps to Implement:**

`1ST Scenario:` Create Seprarate partition during OS Installations üí° <br/>
- I have taken two hard-disk one for os installation and another for storing specific directory content.
  - 20GB Hard-disk OS Installation.
  - 70GB Hard-disk for storing specific directory content. 

- In my case i already created separated the partition `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home` into `70GB` hard-disk. <br/>
- `fdisk -l`- output:

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed54c9fa-13a2-44f0-9412-27e453ffde2f" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- `df -h` command output

  <br>

---

**`üí° 2ND Scenario:`** 
In case you didn‚Äôt set up separate partitions during installation and want to do it now, you can manually configure it using these steps.

<br/>

**üí° Steps to Implement:**

**Identify Available Disks:**
 - Use `sudo fdisk -l` to list available disks.

<br/>

**Create Partitions for `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home`:**
- Use fdisk or parted to create partitions for each directory.

<br/>

**Format Each Partition:**
- Format partitions with the ext4 file system:
```
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 (replace /dev/sda1 with your partition name)
```

<br/>

**Create temporary mount points & copy existing logs**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/var /mnt/var_log /mnt/var_log_audit /mnt/home
sudo mount /dev/sdaw /mnt/var
sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/var_log
sudo mount /dev/sdaY /mnt/var_log_audit
sudo mount /dev/sdaZ /mnt/home

sudo rsync -aAXv /var/ /mnt/var/
sudo rsync -aAXv /var/log/ /mnt/var_log/
sudo rsync -aAXv /var/log/audit/ /mnt/var_log_audit/
sudo rsync -aAXv /home/arijit /mnt/home/  # Copy only the user directory (not the entire /home folder itself)

#If you want to move all users under /home, just do:
sudo rsync -aAXv /home/ /mnt/home/
```
> Note ‚ö† : The trailing slashes means not the home dir but the content of home directory.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c84855af-17eb-4891-bd79-2b3b12d4f709" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>

  <br>

> In the picture above, I made a mistake by using `rsync -av /home`, which results in copying the entire `/home` directory into `/mnt/home`, leading to a nested path like `/mnt/home/home/<username>`.  
>  
> To avoid this, use trailing slashes to copy only the contents of `/home`, like so:  
> `sudo rsync -aAXv /home/ /mnt/home/`  
>  
> Alternatively, if you want to copy a specific user's home directory, use:  
> `sudo rsync -aAXv /home/arijit /mnt/home/`



<br/>

**Update `/etc/fstab` to Persist Mounts:**
 - Add these entries to `/etc/fstab`:
```
/dev/sda1    /var    ext4    defaults    0    2
/dev/sda2    /var/log    ext4    defaults    0    2
/dev/sda3    /var/log/audit    ext4    defaults    0    2
/dev/sda4    /home    ext4    defaults    0    2
```

<br/>

**Verify the Mounts:**
- After updating `/etc/fstab`, mount the partitions: `sudo mount -a`
- Verify by running: `mount | grep /var` OR `df -h`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef8bf710-55d8-477e-98c4-dbd0843ce5dc" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

<br/>

> **Note ‚ö† : If it's shows like these:** 
```
root@arijit:~# mount -a
mount: /var/log/audit: mount point does not exist.
```
> It‚Äôs show because "audit" not exits under "/var/log/", So we have to create one:
```
root@arijit:~# mkdir -p /var/log/audit/

#Now RUN again 
mount -a
```

<br/>

#### Bind mount /var/tmp to /tmp <br/>
- Bind mounting `/var/tmp` to `/tmp` is a security and system management practice used to ensure that the contents of /tmp are stored on a separate partition (in this case, /var/tmp) while still using the same path for access.

**Why Do This?**
- Security: By separating `/tmp` from the root filesystem, you can apply more restrictive mount options (e.g., noexec, nosuid) to "/tmp", improving security.
- Disk Space Management: If `/var` has more disk space, it allows /tmp to grow without affecting the root partition.


**‚úÖ When Should You Use Bind Mount `/tmp` ‚Üí `/var/tmp`?**

Use this setup if:
- You do not have a separate partition for `/tmp`.
- You want to enforce strict security on both `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` (like `noexec, nosuid, nodev`).
- You want to ensure both dirs share the same storage (usually to prevent `/var` from filling up due to temp files).
- You don‚Äôt need persistent temp files between reboots (`/tmp` gets cleared, `/var/tmp` won't anymore).

> Example use case: Minimalist installations or containers where conserving space and reducing partitions is more important than strict separation of temp storage behavior.

<br/>

**‚ùå When Should You Avoid This Setup?**

Avoid bind mount if:
- You've already separated `/tmp` and `/var` to their own partitions.
- You rely on persistent files in `/var/tmp` that should survive across reboots.
- You want to apply different mount options (like `noexec` on `/tmp` but allow execution in `/var/tmp`).
- You care about clear separation of temp file lifetimes for compliance or debugging purposes.
> Bind mounts inherit the mount options of the target. You can‚Äôt set different options for /var/tmp if it‚Äôs a bind mount of /tmp.

<br/>

**üîí Security Tips**

If you want to apply nodev,nosuid,noexec to both `/tmp` and `/var/tmp`, but keep them separate, the best approach is to:
- Create a dedicated partition for `/var/tmp`.
- Mount it separately in `/etc/fstab`.
- Apply your desired security options there.

<br/>

**üí° Steps to Bind Mount `/var/tmp` to `/tmp`:**
- Make sure the  `/var/tmp` directory exists. If it doesn‚Äôt, create it: `sudo mkdir -p /var/tmp`.
 
- Modify `/etc/fstab` to Bind Mount:
    - Edit the `/etc/fstab` file to add a bind mount entry. This ensures that the system will automatically bind mount  `/var/tmp` to `/tmp` on boot: sudo nano /etc/fstab
    - Add the following line at the end of the file: `/var/tmp   /tmp    none    bind,noexec,nosuid,nodev    0   0`
    - This line tells the system to bind mount  `/var/tmp` to `/tmp` every time the system boots.

- Apply the Bind Mount Immediately:
    - To immediately apply the changes without rebooting, run: `sudo mount --bind /var/tmp /tmp`

- Verify the Bind Mount:
    - After applying the changes, verify that the bind mount is working by checking the mount points: `mount | grep /tmp`
    - Try writing files to `/tmp` and confirm that they are stored under  `/var/tmp` by checking the disk usage with `ls /var/tmp`.

---- 

#### Set `nodev` option to /home
- The `nodev` option is used to prevent the mounting of device files in a specific directory. By setting the nodev option on /home, you ensure that no device files (e.g., block or character devices) can be created or accessed within the /home directory. This enhances security by preventing attackers from creating or using device files in user directories.

**üí° Steps to Set nodev Option on `/home`:**
- Modify `/etc/fstab`:
    - Edit the `/etc/fstab` file to include the nodev option for the `/home` partition.
    - `sudo nano /etc/fstab`

- We already have separated partitions for `/home`, find the corresponding line and add the `nodev` option. For example:
- `/dev/sda2    /home    ext4    defaults,nodev    0   2`

  <br>

- After updating `/etc/fstab`, run: `sudo mount -o remount /home`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da5a04dc-fb3e-4102-9f3d-a398d34ca0cc" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

---- 

#### Set nodev, nosuid, and noexec options on /dev/shm

The /dev/shm directory is a temporary file storage location in memory (shared memory). It is used for applications that need fast temporary storage in RAM. However, because it resides in memory, it could be a target for various attacks, especially if applications running on the system use it insecurely. To enhance security, it is essential to set the nodev, nosuid, and noexec options on /dev/shm.

- nodev: Prevents the creation of device files in /dev/shm, mitigating risks of device file exploitation.
- nosuid: Prevents the setuid and setgid bits from taking effect, reducing the risk of privilege escalation through shared memory.
- noexec: Prevents the execution of binaries in /dev/shm, protecting against malicious code that might be placed in the shared memory.

**Why Set These Options?**

Security: Protects against attacks like privilege escalation, code execution, and device file creation within shared memory.
Integrity: Ensures that no untrusted binaries are executed from the memory-backed /dev/shm directory.
Control: Gives administrators control over what can and cannot be done in /dev/shm.


**üí° Steps to Set `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` on `/dev/shm`:**

- Modify `/etc/fstab` to Include the Options:
    - Open the `/etc/fstab` file for editing: `sudo nano /etc/fstab`
    - Add or modify the entry for /dev/shm to include the `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` options. For example:
      
    - `tmpfs     /dev/shm    tmpfs   defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec   0   0`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfc3ce3-ee4b-4c3e-bd65-6bc57c786f76" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

- This line ensures that these security options are applied to the /dev/shm mount point.
- After updating `/etc/fstab`, run: `sudo mount -o remount /dev/shm`

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bef4c1a-ccbb-4627-bcc3-214ee3ed6fa1" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

Verification:
- Check for Device Creation: Try creating a device file in /dev/shm to see if the nodev option is working. It should fail with a permission error.
```
sudo mknod /dev/shm/testdev c 7 0
```
- This should fail if `nodev` is properly set.

- Check for Executable Files: Attempt to execute a file in /dev/shm to see if the noexec option is working.
```
sudo touch /dev/shm/testscript
sudo chmod +x /dev/shm/testscript
/dev/shm/testscript
```
- The file should not execute if `noexec` is set correctly.

> üí° By setting the nodev, nosuid, and noexec options on /dev/shm, you significantly reduce the attack surface of the system, preventing unauthorized device file creation, privilege escalation, and executable code execution in the shared memory space.

#### Set sticky bit on all world-writable directories

- The sticky bit is a permission that can be set on directories to restrict the deletion of files within the directory. When the sticky bit is set, only the file owner, the directory owner, or the root user can delete or rename files within that directory, even if others have write permissions to the directory. This is especially useful for directories like /tmp, where multiple users can write files but shouldn't be able to delete or modify other users' files.

Setting the sticky bit on world-writable directories enhances security by preventing users from accidentally or maliciously deleting or renaming files owned by other users.


**Why Set the Sticky Bit?**

- Prevent Unauthorized File Deletion: Ensures that only the file owner, directory owner, or root user can delete or rename files, even in world-writable directories.
- Improves Security in Shared Directories: Protects sensitive files in shared directories, such as /tmp or /var/tmp.

<br/>

**Find World-Writable Directories:**
- Use the following command to list all directories that are world-writable (`777` permissions or `rwxrwxrwx`):
```
find / -type d -perm -0002 -exec ls -ld {} \; 2> /dev/null
```
- This will search for all directories with world-writable permissions.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6820b047-c9bf-4356-8dc2-30035b77e65e" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

<br/>

**To Set Sticky Bit:**
 - Use the `chmod` command to set the sticky bit on each world-writable directory:
 ```
sudo chmod +t <directory_path>
```

<br/>

**üí° Automate the process:**
- To apply the sticky bit on all world-writable directories, use a loop:
```
find / -type d -perm -0002 -exec sudo chmod +t {} \; 2> /dev/null
```

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/782b3a5a-0c23-46f5-81a9-af3e2f3469f7" alt="fdisk command output" width="650px"></a>
  <br>

<br/>

---- 

#### Enable Hard/Soft Link Protection
- Attackers may exploit insecure hard links and symlinks to access sensitive files or escalate privileges. Enabling protection prevents these attacks by restricting how links can be used.

<br/>


**üí° Steps to configures:**
- Enable Hard and Symlink Protection  
 - Create or modify the system configuration file:  
```
echo "fs.protected_hardlinks = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf  
echo "fs.protected_symlinks = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf  
```

<br/>

- Apply changes immediately:  
```
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf  
```

<br/>

- Verify settings:  
```shell
sysctl fs.protected_hardlinks  
sysctl fs.protected_symlinks
#Expected Output: Both should return 1 (enabled).   
```

  <br>

<br/>

**üí° Understanding the Settings :**  
- 'fs.protected_hardlinks = 1'  
  - Prevents unprivileged users from creating hard links to files they do not own.  
- 'fs.protected_symlinks = 1'  
  - Blocks symlink-based privilege escalation attacks by preventing symlink access to files users don‚Äôt own.

#### Disable Uncommon Filesystems

Disabling unused or uncommon filesystems reduces the attack surface and prevents unauthorized mounting of potentially insecure storage formats.


<br/>

**üí° Steps to configure:**
1. Block Uncommon Filesystems  <br/>
i) Blacklist the filesystems in `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`:  
```
sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf <<EOF
blacklist cramfs
blacklist freevxfs
blacklist jffs2
blacklist hfs
blacklist hfsplus
blacklist squashfs
blacklist udf
blacklist fat
blacklist vfat
blacklist nfs
blacklist nfsv3
blacklist gfs2
EOF
```
- This ensures they are not automatically loaded on boot.

<br/>

2. Apply Changes Immediately  
- Rebuild the initramfs (important for persistence): sudo update-initramfs -u 
- Unload any currently loaded uncommon filesystem modules:  
```
sudo rmmod cramfs freevxfs jffs2 hfs hfsplus squashfs udf fat vfat nfs nfsv3 gfs2 2>/dev/null
```

- Verify the settings:  
```
lsmod | grep -E 'cramfs|freevxfs|jffs2|hfs|hfsplus|squashfs|udf|fat|vfat|nfs|nfsv3|gfs2'
```

  <br>

<br/>

üí°   Understanding the Settings  
- `install <module> /bin/false`  
    - Prevents the filesystem from being loaded as a kernel module.  
- `blacklist <module>`      
    - Stops the kernel from automatically loading these filesystems.  
- `update-initramfs -u`  
    - Ensures changes are applied in the boot process.

#### Lock The Boot Directory 
- The /boot directory contains critical bootloader files, such as the kernel and GRUB configurations. If an attacker modifies these files, they can gain persistent access or bypass security measures. Locking the /boot directory prevents unauthorized modifications.

<br/>


**üí° Steps to Lock the Boot Directory :** 

**Set Boot Directory as Read-Only**  
- Modify `/etc/fstab` to prevent accidental modifications: `sudo nano /etc/fstab` 
- Add the following line (or modify the existing '/boot' entry):  
```
UUID=<BOOT_PARTITION_UUID> /boot ext4 defaults,ro 0 1

OR
    
LABEL=/boot /boot ext4 defaults,ro 0 1
```

  <br>

- Replace '<BOOT_PARTITION_UUID>' with the actual UUID of the boot partition (find it using 'blkid').  
- 'ro' sets the directory as read-only.  

<br/>

**Restrict File Permissions**  
- Ensure only root can modify boot files:
```
sudo chown -R root:root /boot
sudo chmod -R 700 /boot
```
