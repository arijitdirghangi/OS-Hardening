#### Create a separate partition with the `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` options set for `/tmp`  <br/>
- Creating a separate partition for `/tmp` with the `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` options ensures better security by restricting potentially dangerous operations in temporary directories. This can help mitigate the risks associated with untrusted files, as well as prevent certain types of attacks, like privilege escalation and executing malicious code from temporary files.

- nodev: Prevents device files from being created in the "/tmp" directory.
- nosuid: Prevents the execution of set-user-identifier (SUID) programs in "/tmp".
- noexec: Prevents the execution of any binaries from the "/tmp" directory.

üí° Steps to Implement:
- During OS installation i already separated the `/tmp` to another hard-disk, so now we just need to set `nodev`, `nosuid`, and `noexec` on `/tmp` folder.
- There is a entry for `/tmp` directory already exits in `/etc/fstab` file, we need to modify line

  <br>

- Now open `/etc/fstab` file in editor : `nano /etc/fstab`
- Add `nodev,nosuid,noexec` in the following line.

  <br>

- After updating `/etc/fstab`, run: `sudo mount -o remount /tmp`
- Verify the mount : `df -h /tmp` && `mount | grep /tmp`

  <br>

- To ensure the options are applied correctly, check if the partition prevents execution and device files creation:
- Try creating a device file in `/tmp`: `sudo -u <username> mknod /tmp/testdevice c 1 3`
  - It should fail because `nodev` is set

  <br>

- Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - If anyone run this command as `root` user it will `bypass` the restriction, so it's always good practice to lock `root` user account.   

- Try running an executable from `/tmp`: `nano /tmp/check.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo LOL

chmod +x /tmp/check.sh
/tmp/check.sh
```

  <br>

- It should fail because `noexec` is set.
  - Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
    - The `noexec` mount option is applied to `/tmp`, preventing direct execution of files. However, this restriction can be bypassed by explicitly invoking an interpreter, such as: `bash /tmp/check.sh`

  <br>    
 - To fully mitigate this risk:
 - Use `AppArmor` or `SELinux` to enforce execution restrictions at the system level.

#### Create separate partitions for `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home` <br/>
- Creating separate partitions for `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home` provides better isolation, security, and management of system resources. These partitions allow for independent management, such as setting appropriate mount options and file system types, which can help protect sensitive data, ensure log retention, and optimize performance. It also prevents one partition from filling up and impacting others.


üí° Steps to Implement:

`1ST Scenario:` Create Seprarate partition during OS Installations üí° <br/>
- I have taken two hard-disk one for os installation and another for storing specific directory content.
  - 20GB Hard-disk OS Installation.
  - 70GB Hard-disk for storing specific directory content. 

- In my case i already created separated the partition `/var`, `/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, and `/home` into `70GB` hard-disk. <br/>
- `fdisk -l`- output:

  <br>

- `df -h` command output

  <br>

`2ND Scenario:` After OS installation manually  partitioned the disk and moved directories like `/home`, `/var`, etc. to separate partitions.
